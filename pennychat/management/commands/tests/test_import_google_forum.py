I don\'t think he was first to coin the phrase.  I believe it came from Anders Ericsson (book (https://catalog.library.nashville.org/OverDrive/5b48e06d-2ee2-4ff4-b2b3-bd80e6d8380e/Home)).  I have been interested in it as I have seen from golf that focused practice brings improvement rather than just being present.  At its core, it is the intentional focus on improving the skills that matter in your field.  For Cal, it started with trying to understand the habits of his more successful students.  He has since created a program to help people source the skills that matter and devise a plan to work on those skills.\n\nI would like to post the questions here to see what the Penny University thinks.\n\n- What developers do you admire?\n- What abilities do they possess that make them different or better?\n\n- When you hire, what are you looking for?\n\n- What characteristics of junior (new) developers do you appreciate?\n\n- What do you think your employer pays for?\n', 'date': '2017-01-23T14:28:31-08:00', 'user': 'upjohnc@gmail.com'}, {'content': "I like these questions, and I think deliberate practice is important. Truthfully, I probably don't do enough of it...maybe this will get me to do more. Anyway, here are my answers to your questions:\n\n\n- What developers do you admire?\n>\n\nRich Hickey, Armin Ronacher, Alex Gaynor, DHH, Jason Myers, Jason Orendorff, and probably a dozen or so others whose names escape me at the moment.\n \n- What abilities do they possess that make them different or better?\n>\n\nIt's hard to say what specific abilities each one possesses, but I'd say that generally they all have a curious nature, a desire to dig into and understand a problem, and a demonstrated ability to think critically and communicate clearly about that problem. The importance of the critical thinking and communication cannot be overstated.\n\n \n> - When you hire, what are you looking for?\n>\n\nThat would heavily depend on what the position is and what the expected experience level of the candidate is, but something that I think is a constant is that I want someone who wants to know more and will fail quickly but not _too_ quickly (they'll try to figure something out on their own, but won't waste a day spinning their wheels before asking for help). I think if you have those two things, I think there are a number of other personality traits those things imply that make for someone I want to work with.\n\n\n- What characteristics of junior (new) developers do you appreciate?\n>\n\nSee above.\n\n \n> - What do you think your employer pays for?\n>\n\nPhew, this is a heavy question. I think they pay for the ability to solve a problem. The more you're paid (that is, the further up the Jr -> Mid -> Sr ladder you are) the more they're paying for efficiency and correctness. I'm a firm believer that people aren't paying specifically for your time, or your ability to be in a certain place for a certain amount of time.\n ", 'date': '2017-01-24T09:34:49-08:00', 'user': 'bill.israel@gmail.com'}, {'content': "Jason Myers was gracious enough to give me his time so I could pick his brain on his path to becoming a software engineer.\n\nJason's trek in coding started with walking through Python the Hard Way.
